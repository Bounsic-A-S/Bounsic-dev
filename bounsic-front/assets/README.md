## ðŸŽ¨ Fonts Used in Bounsic

This project uses two primary fonts to achieve a clean and modern aesthetic that matches the Bounsic identity:

- **Poppins** â€“ Used only for headings to bring a bold and friendly feel.
- **Roboto** â€“ Used for headings and all paragraphs, form inputs, and general content to ensure great readability and neutrality.

These fonts were downloaded via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and globally applied through `styles.css` using Tailwind CSS.
