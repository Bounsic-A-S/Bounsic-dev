## 🎨 Fonts Used in Bounsic

This project uses two primary fonts to achieve a clean and modern aesthetic that matches the Bounsic identity:

- **Poppins** – Used only for headings to bring a bold and friendly feel.
- **Roboto** – Used for headings and all paragraphs, form inputs, and general content to ensure great readability and neutrality.

These fonts were downloaded via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and globally applied through `styles.css` using Tailwind CSS.

## 🌐 Internationalization (i18n)

Bounsic is built with a global audience in mind. The application supports internationalization using [`@ngx-translate/core`](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core), allowing dynamic language switching.

### Supported Languages:

- 🇪🇸 **Spanish (es)** – Default language for Bounsic becuase of it's origin in Latin American.
- 🇺🇸 **English (en)** – For global accessibility and international users.
- 🇰🇷 **Korean (kr)** – To connect with the K-pop community and Korean-speaking users.
